Checksum calculation subroutine

Differences:

The checksum value is stored in C3DB.
Odd digits 1/24, 3/24 etc are doubled, if > 10 then 9 is subtracted. // should be if > 9 (or if >= 10)
These values are added together.
Even digits 2/24, 4/24 etc are just added together.
These two resulting numbers are added, converted to decimal and stored at C3DB.
// The resulting number isn't actually just converted to decimal
// - the units digit is: ceil(sum / 10) % 10 
// - the tens digit is: (10 - (sum % 10)) % 10
// If it was actually converted to decimal, the units digit would simply be floor(sum/10) and the units digit sum%10


Summary:

- Sum all the 22 first digits (converted from ASCII):
  - The 1st, 3rd, ... digits are doubled, and if >= 10, subtract 9
  - The 2nd, 4th, ... digits are simply added to the sum
- The sum is % 256 (since it was stored in one byte on the GB)
- Convert the sum to decimal using the following:
  - The units digit is: ceil(sum / 10) % 10
  - The tens digit is: (10 - (sum % 10)) % 10
